# vserv: the store over a socket

`src/vserv.c` serves one store file: Linux epoll, one worker thread per CPU the process may use (its affinity mask and
cgroup quota, times `-g`), a request buffer per connection (allocated on its first byte, reused after; it grows for a
request that carries a big text and shrinks back), replies built in a per-thread buffer - a search allocates nothing.
The store is opened with `store_load` (mmap), so a 100M-row file is ready in milliseconds.

```sh
./run                                    # builds .build/vserv (BearSSL into .build/libbearssl.a first)
.build/vserv -s /run/vx.sock -p 8077 -t 2 -d 384 docs.vxi        # Unix socket (0600) + TCP on 127.0.0.1; a new store
.build/vserv -p 8077 -L -r 0.95 -l syslog docs.vxi               # live: adds indexed as they come; log to syslog
.build/vserv -p 8077 -g 0.5 docs.vxi                             # half the CPUs; background work at nice 14, disk when idle
.build/vserv -p 8077 -m 1 docs.vxi                               # the scanned codes locked in RAM, rows read from the disk
.build/vserv -p 8443 -c cert.pem -k key.pem [-a clients-ca.pem] [-T] docs.vxi   # TLS, optional mutual TLS
curl -s localhost:8077/stats
curl -s -X POST 'localhost:8077/search?k=5' -d '[0.1, 0.2, ...]'
```

## Three protocols on every socket

They are told apart by the first byte of a request, so one connection can mix them.

**Lines** (a lowercase letter first): one line in, one line out, for `nc`, `socat` and a readline in any language.
A session over TCP, word for word:

```
add 1 1 0 0 0                 ok
add 2 0 1 0 0                 ok
search 2 0.9 0.1 0 0          ok 2 1 -0.012233 2 -1.779137
stats                         ok count=2 dim=4 pending=2 built=0 snapshot=idle last=none hot=8 cold=64 memory=0
del 1 2                       ok 2
quit                          ok bye
```

The commands: `ping`, `stats`, `search K X1 .. XD`, `add ID X1 .. XD`, `get ID`, `del ID`, `del LO HI` (every id in
the range), `build`, `save`, `snapshot`, `help`, `quit`. A reply is `ok ...` or `err WHAT`; scores are `-|q - v|^2`
of the unit vectors, with 6 decimals.

Texts (see [api.md](api.md#texts-from-a-small-chunk-to-the-whole-document)): `addt ID X1 .. XD TEXT` adds a row with
a text, the rest of the line, with `\n` `\r` `\t` `\0` `\\` for the bytes a line cannot carry; `text ID` answers
`ok LEN TEXT` escaped the same way; `range LO HI [MAX]` lists the ids in the range, ascending; `hybrid K X1 .. XD
WORDS` and `words K WORDS` search with the words against the texts (BM25), with or without a vector, and answer like
`search` with fused scores (bigger is better):

```
addt 7340032 1 0 0 0 Oolong is partly oxidised.   ok
text 7340032                                       ok 26 Oolong is partly oxidised.
range 7340032 8388607                              ok 1 7340032
words 3 oxidised                                   ok 1 7340032 0.049180
```

**Binary** (`0xB5` first): little-endian frames, nothing to parse - `u8 0xB5, u8 op, u16 k, u32 nbytes, payload`.
Ops: 1 search, 2 add, 3 delete, 4 build, 5 save, 6 stats, 7 snapshot, 8 get, 9 delete a range of ids, 10 add with a
text, 11 get a text, 12 the ids in a range, 13 hybrid search.

**HTTP/1.1** (anything else): `GET /health`, `GET /stats`, `GET /get?id=N`, `GET /text?id=N`,
`GET /range?lo=&hi=&max=`, `POST /search?k=`, `/hybrid?k=`, `/add?id=`, `/delete?id=` or `/delete?lo=&hi=`, `/build`,
`/save`, `/snapshot`; vectors as a JSON array or raw little-endian f32 (an add's text after the floats), or
`{"vector": [...], "text": "..."}` for an add with a text and for `/hybrid` (either key); keep-alive, pipelining. The header scan looks for the blank line 16 bytes at a time with SSE2 (the picohttpparser
idea, cut down to what this server needs).

In all three an add replaces the row with the same id: one row per id. A request may carry up to 8 MB of text: the
buffer of a connection starts small, grows for a big request and goes back once it is answered. The full reference is the comment at the top
of `src/vserv_proto.c`.

## Durability: a journal and background snapshots, no replication

Every write goes into the journal next to the file (`docs.vxi.j`), which is flushed to the disk every second (`-f
SECONDS`; 0 leaves it to the kernel), so a crash loses at most that second. A new store's file is created at start,
so the journal covers it from the first write. A background snapshot folds the journal into the file: a child process
writes a copy-on-write image of the store while the server keeps answering and taking writes; the writes made
meanwhile go to both journals, and the new one takes over when the file is complete. One starts whenever the journal
has outgrown the file (and 64 MB), every `-S SECONDS` when something changed, and on `snapshot` from a client.
`tests/vserv_test.c` kills the server with `kill -9` a second after a burst of adds and finds every one of them after
the restart; `tests/scrash.c` does the same to the store at random moments, with snapshots running.

Several writes go in together with a batch, begun and ended on the line protocol; what comes in between, in any
of the three protocols on that connection, waits ("ok queued") and searches do not see it yet:

```
begin                         ok
del 2097152 3145727           ok queued
addt 2097152 0.1 ... first chunk of the new version     ok queued
addt 2097153 0.2 ... second chunk                       ok queued
commit sync                   ok 3
```

`commit` applies all of it at once and journals it as one record with a CRC-32C, so a crash leaves all or none of it;
`commit sync` replies once it is on the disk (commits that arrive during an fsync share the next one). `abort`, or
closing the connection, drops it. A tenant cannot be switched while a batch is open.

There is no replication inside the server. A copy of the store is the file plus its journal, both written atomically
(`rename`), so `rsync` or `cp` of the two at any moment is a consistent backup; a standby machine that replays them
starts in milliseconds (mmap). A snapshot to another path (`store_snapshot` / `vi_snapshot` with a path) writes a
point-in-time copy without touching the live journal.

## Memory: hot codes in RAM, cold rows on the disk

A search scans the hot part of a store every time: the index's codes (1, 2 or 4 bits a dimension), its slot table and
centroids. It reads the cold part only for the few hundred candidates it re-scores and the hits it returns: the rows
(f32 or int8), ids, tags and texts. The file is mapped, so by default the kernel keeps what searches touch and drops
the rarely read rows first under pressure. `-m` takes that decision away from it:

| `-m` | locked in RAM | on the disk, read when needed |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (default) | nothing; the codes are read ahead at start | everything, cached as the kernel sees fit |
| 1 | the hot part | rows, ids, tags, texts |
| 2 | the hot part, rows, ids and tags | texts |

`stats` reports both sizes (`hot=` and `cold=` in bytes) and the tier. For 100M rows of 768 dimensions with 1-bit
codes and f32 rows that is about 10 GB hot (96 bytes of codes and 4 of slot table a row) and 307 GB cold: `-m 1`
keeps the 10 GB in RAM and the exact f32 rows on an SSD, read only for the candidates. The lock needs a memlock limit
that large (`ulimit -l`, or `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity` in a systemd unit); what it refuses is only read ahead, and the
server says so at start. In C: `vi_set_memory` and `vi_memory` ([api.md](api.md)).

## Access and accountability: the operating system and the log, no users and roles

Who may connect is decided outside the server: the Unix socket is created mode 0600 (owner only; change its group and
mode to share it), the TCP port binds to 127.0.0.1 unless `-b` says otherwise, and `-a CA` lets in only clients with a
certificate from that CA. What each connection did goes to the log, one line per event (`-l syslog`, `-l -` for
stderr, `-l FILE`), with the peer of every line: `uid`, `gid` and `pid` on the Unix socket (`SO_PEERCRED`), address
and port on TCP, and the certificate's name under mutual TLS - kept across session resumptions. From the session
above, with `-l - -A`:

```
2026-10-30T00:05:54Z vserv[21369] start file=/tmp/demo.vxi rows=0 dim=4 threads=2 created journal=on memory=0 hot=0 cold=0
2026-10-30T00:05:55Z vserv[21369] conn=1 peer=tcp:127.0.0.1:52036 open
2026-10-30T00:05:55Z vserv[21369] conn=1 peer=tcp:127.0.0.1:52036 add id=1 ok
2026-10-30T00:05:55Z vserv[21369] conn=1 peer=tcp:127.0.0.1:52036 add id=2 ok
2026-10-30T00:05:55Z vserv[21369] conn=1 peer=tcp:127.0.0.1:52036 search k=2 hits=2 us=7
2026-10-30T00:05:55Z vserv[21369] conn=1 peer=tcp:127.0.0.1:52036 del lo=1 hi=2 removed=2
2026-10-30T00:05:55Z vserv[21369] conn=1 peer=tcp:127.0.0.1:52036 close requests=6
2026-10-30T00:05:56Z vserv[21369] stop rows=0
```

Writes, connections, refused requests, failed TLS handshakes and snapshots are logged once `-l` is given; searches
only with `-A`. A bulk load logs one line per row: for millions of rows prefer `-l FILE` to syslog, which journald
rate-limits.

## Tenants: a store file each

Given a directory instead of a file, the server keeps a store per tenant in it, `DIR/NAME.vxi` with its own journal,
index and snapshots; workers, the log and the housekeeping are shared. A client names its tenant before anything else:

```sh
.build/vserv -p 8077 -d 384 -l syslog /srv/vx/                # every tenant's store has 384 dimensions
printf 'use acme\nsearch 5 0.1 ...\n' | nc localhost 8077      # lines: use NAME, then as on a one-store server
curl -s -X POST 'localhost:8077/t/acme/search?k=5' -d '[0.1, ...]'   # HTTP: /t/NAME/ before every path
```

The binary protocol has op 14 with the name as its payload; until a tenant is chosen every other request gets status
5 (lines: `err no tenant: use NAME first`; HTTP: 400). A tenant opens on first use (mmap, milliseconds), or is created
there when its file does not exist yet, and stays open; up to 4096 at once. Names are 1 to 64 of `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -`,
so a name never leaves the directory. Every log line of a connection carries its tenant (`tenant=acme`), and opening
or creating one is logged.

Which client may use which tenant is, again, not a table of users inside the server. With mutual TLS (`-a CA`) and
`-U`, a client may use only the tenant its certificate names, so issuing the certificate is granting the access;
clients without a certificate (local ones on the Unix socket, whose file mode decides who connects) may use any.
Another split is a server per group of tenants, each with its own directory and socket, whose file mode and group
decide who connects.

## TLS

`-c`/`-k`: TLS 1.2 through the vendored [BearSSL](https://bearssl.org) 0.6 (MIT, unmodified, no crypto code of our
own): ECDHE only (forward secrecy), AEAD suites only (AES-GCM with AES-NI, ChaCha20-Poly1305), EC or RSA keys,
sessions resumed from one cache shared by every worker, keys wiped when a connection closes. `-a CA` requires client
certificates (mutual TLS). TLS is sniffed per connection (`0x16`): the TCP port takes only TLS (`-P` lets plaintext in
too); the Unix socket takes TLS or, for local tools, plaintext (`-T`: TLS only).

## Measured

2.4 MB idle RSS; 4.2 KB per open plaintext connection, 20.7 KB per TLS connection (300 open). From Python clients on
2 cores: ~15-19k searches/s plaintext, ~10.7k over TLS on the first 2-core host; 8.9-10.6k and 5.7-7.5k on the Cascade
Lake host of [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md) (2k rows; the Python clients are the bottleneck). `-L` puts the store in
live mode (added rows are indexed by the server's own thread and the index is rebuilt in the background as it ages -
no `/build` calls) and `-r 0.95` keeps recall@10 at 0.95 (the probes tuned on the queries it answers); see "Live
ingest" in [store.md](store.md).

## Tests

`py/vserv_test.py` (29 checks: the binary protocol and HTTP, both sockets, pipelining, a request trickled byte by
byte, oversized and malformed input, 8 concurrent clients, SIGTERM saves, restart, live mode: 3000 adds over the
socket and no build call) and `py/vserv_tls_test.py` (22 checks: resumption on every reconnect, multi-record replies,
plaintext refused, untrusted CA, mTLS accept/reject, RSA key, curl, TLS on the Unix socket), and `tests/vserv_test.c`
(the line protocol and its errors, the binary and HTTP snapshot, get and range-delete calls, replace-on-add, the log
and its peers, kill -9 against the journal, timed snapshots, and the certificate name of a curl client under mutual
TLS in the log) run in `./run`.
