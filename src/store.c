/* store.c - a RAG-shaped vector store on top of engine.c.
 *
 * The engine is an index KERNEL (row ids, no persistence, immutable).
 * A RAG corpus needs your own doc ids on results, incremental add,
 * delete, metadata filtering, concurrent readers, bad-input rejection,
 * and surviving a restart without rebuilding. This wraps all of that
 * around the engine without touching it.
 *
 *   store_add(_meta) / store_add_batch : append (vector, doc_id[, meta]),
 *       unit-normalised; a vector with a NaN / Inf component is rejected
 *       (return -1), never poisons the index.
 *   store_delete           : tombstone a doc_id.
 *   store_build            : compact + rebuild the committed index over
 *       every live vector; clears the pending tail.
 *   store_search           : committed index + an exact scan of the not-
 *       yet-built pending tail, merged (same -||q-v||^2 scale); returns
 *       YOUR doc ids, skips tombstones. Safe to call from many threads.
 *   store_search_filter    : same, keeping only rows whose i64 meta tag
 *       matches (all_bits set) and (any_bits, if non-zero, intersect).
 *   store_save / store_load : the compacted vectors + doc ids + meta +
 *       build goal AND the built index itself to one .vxi file, so load
 *       is O(file), not O(rebuild).
 *   store_sync             : flush the journal of adds/deletes since the last save (PATH.j) to the disk;
 *       the write lock is held only while the stdio buffers go out, not through the fsync.
 *   store_snapshot / store_snapshot_poll : the same file, written in the background by a child process (fork:
 *       a copy-on-write image of the store at this moment) while searches and writes go on. Writes made
 *       meanwhile go to the old journal and to the new file's (PATH.jn), which takes over once the file is
 *       complete; whenever a crash comes, the file on disk and one of the journals belong together (the v7
 *       header and the journal carry the same 64-bit stamp).
 *
 * Memory, so a store can grow far past RAM:
 *   - rows live in column chunks of 65536 rows (vectors, doc ids, tags). A chunk never moves, so growing never
 *     copies anything (no realloc spike, no second copy left behind) and row pointers stay valid;
 *   - past STORE_SPILL_MIN bytes new chunks are pages of an unlinked file (store_set_spill; /var/tmp by default)
 *     instead of anonymous memory: the kernel writes them back and drops them under pressure instead of
 *     swapping or OOM-killing. A loaded store points its chunks straight into the .vxi mapping;
 *   - what a search scans (the 4-bit codes, the dead-row bitset) stays in RAM: d/2 bytes + 1 bit a row. The
 *     f32 rows are only read for the few hundred candidates re-scored per query; when those reads start missing
 *     the page cache, the kernel is asked for all of them at once (MADV_WILLNEED) instead of one fault at a time;
 *   - doc ids that arrive in increasing order (the usual case) need no id map at all: lookups binary-search the
 *     id column. Only rows added out of order go into a hash of row numbers (8 bytes a slot);
 *   - for the largest stores two knobs trade a little recall for a lot of room (store_set_codes,
 *     store_set_vec_bytes): 2-bit or 1-bit codes (d/4 or d/8 bytes a row in RAM instead of d/2) and int8 rows on
 *     disk (d + 4 bytes instead of 4d). 100M rows of 96 dimensions with 2-bit codes need 2.8 GB of RAM and 11.6 GB
 *     of disk.
 *
 * Self-tuning: store_set_target_recall(s, 0.95) and the store keeps that recall@10 on its own - every build
 * measures recall against exact search and picks the fewest IVF probes that reach it, on the queries it has
 * actually been answering (a reservoir of the last STORE_QLOG) or, before there are enough, on its own rows;
 * store_tune re-measures on demand, as the data or the traffic drift.
 *
 * Live mode: store_set_live(s, 1, grow) and nobody has to call store_build again. A thread of the store's own codes
 * each added row into its closest cluster (until then the pending tail's exact scan finds it); when the index has
 * aged - grown by `grow`, a window of new rows sitting far from every centroid (the data moved), a quarter of it
 * deleted - it rebuilds on a snapshot of the rows while searches go on with the old index, and swaps the new one in;
 * with a target recall set it re-tunes after each. The work runs on half the cores. store_maintain runs one such
 * step by hand. store_save writes the appended rows into the file's plain layout, and deletes no longer cost the
 * saved index: compaction renumbers the rows inside it instead of dropping it.
 *
 * Concurrency: an rwlock - store_search(_filter) take the read lock and
 * touch no shared mutable state (own malloc scratch, engine_search_into
 * path) except the query reservoir, behind its own mutex that a search only
 * try-locks (a busy reservoir skips the query, nobody waits); everything
 * that mutates takes the write lock.
 *
 *   gcc -std=c89 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L -O2 \
 *       -march=native -Isrc tests/store_test.c -lm -lpthread -o store_test && ./store_test
